# TuneWave

A musical quiz website which started as a university assignement and turned into a challenge to be made entirely with native HTML, JS and CSS.

This website was also to test the extent of ChatGPT's data, as a matter of fact, all the musical data used here is generated by ChatGPT 3.5 and appended to a JSON file.
